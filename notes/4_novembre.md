# clinical records, patient records, health records

Clinical $$\rightarrow$$ in a single Reparto. Patient  $$\rightarrow$$  follow the patient in the recovery. Health  $$\rightarrow$$  follows the patient during all his life.

Google Health is an example of personal health record, now closed.

Patient and Health are balanced: one is responsability of the hospital, one of the patient.

Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico (PHR, Personal Health Record) is an example of the latter. There are also personal information, included photos of moles sent to your dermatologist. Differently from EHR it can last for a whole life.( What happens to the data when someone dies? It has to be preserved for a while but then?) The users, in PHR, includes the patient, not only clinical personnel, who can share, retrieve and delete his own informations (law abiding, of course).

Interoperability will be the topic for the next weeks.

## uncertainty management

There are many issues about medical data that we have to consider. Data formats, attachments, standard language, "referto", "reperto", ambiguities.

Usually it's text or attached documents. check [wHospital](http://www.whealth.care/solutions/whospital/)

HIE : Health Information Exchange. Wanted by Obama, forced all producers of health records, and hospital, to grant interoperability between different softwares and different hospitals. It's not working very well, because private healthcare push towards patient fidelization.

Over years, trend is moving from enterprise EHRs to PHRs.

# biodata

Data, whose information is not dependant from its value over time, generated by a biological entity. It's a parameter that describe a biological system. It has a reference value to be compared with. Can be categorical, discrete, continuous, whatever. It is associated to a measure unit. It has to be healthy thresholds (max/min), that can change over years with new literature. They must be referred to a patient, of course, and a specific point in time. They often include responsible person (medic, nurse, etc.) for data and procedure recordings. Methods that produced the data itself has to been recorded, because different methods may imply different values for the same real data.  So it's never "a float", it's always a complex multivalued data structure.

### additional biodata

If I add a time dimension, I have a **signal**. If I add a space dimension, I've an **image**. If I add both, I've got a **video recording**.

Biosignals are extremely linked to how it is acquired: there is an analogic signal (continous over time and amplitude) generation, and a digital conversion (discretization over time (sampling) and amplitude (quantization)). Signals can be multichannel (different signals over the same time)

Signals are saved as arrays (1 dimension per channel, time is implicit, knowing the sampling frequency). A whole record can include many channels, and hase a lot of metadata (type of record, additional annotations, patient data, technician, time, etc).

Images can be 2D or 3D. Radiographies, PET, SPECT, NRM, CT, whatever. Quantization and sampling becomes pixels.
